A month ago a black stone meteorite has landed on the Earth.
<br>People thought it was just a harmless rock from the space, but it turned out they were wrong.
<br>Strange things started to happen since then.
<br>Animals were aggressive and plant's fruit was inedible.
<br>However, things got even crazier.
<br>Plants got up from the ground and started to attack citizens.
<br>They transformed into some kind of mutated monsters.
<br>But there is a way to destroy them.
<br>You could of course eliminate every single mutated plant, however that would take a long time.
<br>Lucky for us, these mutants have their "heart"-like thing which they all are bound to.
<br>If you destroy the heart they all should fall.
<br>Their heart is hidden in local high school find it and destroy it.
